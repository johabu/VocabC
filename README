===========================Download and installing===========================

First download the file (VocabC.zip or VocabC.tar.gz) and extract the files
or clone the repository

Compiling:
	Linux:
		Type the following commands in a shell:
			cd /PATH/TO/VocabC/
			make install
	Windows:
		Compile the files, e.g. with your Visual Studio Express or a Intel C/C++
		compiler.

Configuration:
	When running 'make install' the program creates an config file
	located in HOME/.config/vocabc/ . If not, copy "conf.txt" in this
	directory and rename it into "config".
	In the config file you can save your default settings, e.g. random
	order by default. Look at this file to see which settings you can save.

=====================================Use=====================================

VocabC is a simple vocabulary trainer. 
One point is that you can use it with different languages.

1)	To use the program, first create a vocab file.
		!!!	The vocab has to be in this format:	!!!
		!!!		word1=word2a,word2b		!!!
	Example: file name is e.g. "voc_1.txt"
		Personal=personnel,staff	#several meanings possible
		#english-german/spanish		#comments with '#' (must be the first character in the line)
		german=deutsch,alem√°n		#many languages possible (ISO 8859-15)
		to fit=caber#in english		#spaces possible; comments for one side possible
	See also the vocabulary file "example.txt"

2)	Start the program:
	type:	VocabC -f <file>	
		If this doesn't work, try ./VocabC <options> in the directory in which you installed the program.
		Check also your PATH variable.
	
	Optional arguments:
		-h		Show help
		-r		Random order of words
		-d1		Program asks the first word
		-d2		Program asks the second word
		-dr		Program sets direction randomly
		-n <num>	ask <num> words
		-s		case-sensitivity
	
	If you stored settings in a configuration file, you don't need to set optional arguments.
	If you set some, settings from the configuration file are overwritten.

3)	Use:
	The program asks you for the word on the right side in the file.
	(when you set -d2 (-dr) , it asks you (maybe) for the left one)
	You have to type the word from the right side.
	Be careful with the spelling! You have two tries, e.g. if you misspelled a word.
	At the end it shows you an analysis (correct words in percent).
