=====================================Use=====================================

VocabC is a simple vocabulary trainer. 
One point is that you can use it with different languages.

1)	To use the program, first create a vocab file.
		!!!	The vocab has to be in this format:	!!!
		!!!		word1=word2a,word2b		!!!
	Example: file name is e.g. "voc_1.txt"
		Personal=personnel,staff	#several meanings possible
		#english-german/spanish		#comments with '#' (must be the first character in the line)
		german=deutsch,alem√°n		#many languages possible (ISO 8859-15)
		to fit=caber#in english		#spaces possible; comments for one side possible
	See also the vocabulary file "example.txt"

2)	Start the program:
	type:	VocabC -f <file>	
		If this doesn't work, try ./VocabC <options> in the directory in which you installed the program.
		Check also your PATH variable.
	
	Optional arguments:
		-h		Show help
		-r		Random order of words
		-d1		Program asks the first word
		-d2		Program asks the second word
		-dr		Program sets direction randomly
		-n <num>	ask <num> words
		-s		case-sensitivity

3)	Use:
	The program asks you for the word on the right side in the file.
	(when you set -d2, it asks you for the left one)
	You have to type the word from the right side.
	Be careful with the spelling! You have two tries, e.g. if you misspelled a word.
	At the end it shows you an analysis (correct words in percent).
