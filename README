=====================================Use=====================================

VocabC is a simple vocabulary trainer. 
One point is that you can use it with different languages.

1)	To use the program, first create a vocab file.
		!!!	The vocab has to be in this format:	!!!
		!!!		word1=word2			!!!
	Example: file name is e.g. "voc_1.txt"
		hello=hallo
		Zeit=time
		comer=eat

2)	Start the program:
	type:	VocabC -f <file>
	
	Optional arguments:
		-h		Show help
		-r		Random order of the words
		-d1		Program asks the first word
		-d2		Program asks the second word
		-n <num>	ask <num> words

3)	Use:
	The program asks you the word on the left side in the file.
	You have to type the word on the right side.
	Be careful with the spelling!
	At the end it shows you a analysis (correct words in percent)
